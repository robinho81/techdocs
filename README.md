Tools to help build, publish and host a set of HTML documents for use as help files within an application e.g. tooltips and hints.

Pages can be generated from markdown documents in a git repository.
Hints or tooltips can be generated from text files. 

Both these get published against a particular version number for an application.

This golang project will allow the user to crawl directories for markdown documents and convert these to HTML.
